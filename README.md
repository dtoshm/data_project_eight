Movie API Analysis

In the project files, youâ€™ll find a list of 10 Oscar-winning movies and their IMDB ids. Your team needs you to gather data on these movies for an analysis. Using the OMDb API and the IMDB ids from the CSV, gather data on each movie and save the information into a CSV file. Then answer a few questions about the data using JupyterLab.
